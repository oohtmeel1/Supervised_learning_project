628,1998-12-21,   Chairperson Born  her testimony was essentially no different than what  shes been saying since May when the Concept Release was published.,neg
629,1998-12-21,  She  focused her testimony mostly on the LTCM meltdown and did not really speak to  the issue of the appropriateness of derivatives regulation by the CFTC.,pos
630,1998-12-21,  She  only continued to assert that the Concept Release raised necessary questions  about the OTC market regulate risk in OTC markets.,neg
631,1998-12-21,    She said that the LTCM situation arose because of the use of derivatives in  highly speculative activities.,pos
632,1998-12-21,  LTCM had excessive margin obligations to  futures exchanges capital transparency reporting requirements that allow firms to take positions that jeopardise  markets and avoid appropriate regulation.,neg
633,1998-12-21, She indicated a hope that the Presidents Working Group would complete its  studies on OTC derivatives and on hedge funds early in  CFTC would work closely with other agencies toward that end.,pos
634,1998-12-21,   Commissioner Tull  echoed Borns testimony disclosure mean that regulation is required  the responses will be important to the  CFTC in dealing with situations like LTCM.,pos
635,1998-12-21,   Commissioner Holum  indicated that the CFTC should definitely not act  until the Presidents Working Group PWG completes its studies on  derivatives and hedge funds AND until Congress has evaluated the results of  those studies and considered the issue fully in CEA reauthorization  hearings.,pos
636,1998-12-21,  She said CEA legislation is the appropriate forum for  reexamination of OTC regulation.,neg
637,1998-12-21,  She added that regulators shouldnt be  able to hide behind interpretations of static old regulation must evolve with the markets.,neg
638,1998-12-21, Holum said the LTCM situation occurred due to excessive leverage from a bad investment strategy and overextension of credit by lenders.,neg
639,1998-12-21,  The  CFTC should not jump to regulation because of one firms poor management this could drive business offshore.,neg

1553,1999-01-13, Mark  The response from Richard is that we are happy with UK courts so long as our  counterparty is in the UK there is any chance that submission to the exclusive jurisdiction of UK  courts might not be fully enforced in the counterpartys country go to arbitration.,pos

1556,1999-01-13, Thanks Mark Scott Sefton JonesHOUECTECT  My sense is that the market custom here is to use the English courts arbitration.,pos

1561,1999-01-13, In the US we have changed our swap agreement forms to provide for arbitration  in order to avoid having to explain the intricacies of derivatives trading to  judges or jurisdiction of Canadian courts on the theory that there are no juries in  civil actions and arbitration is rarely used in Canadian contracts  generally.,neg
1562,1999-01-13,  As we are presently in the process of revising our UK swap  agreement forms agreements.,pos
1563,1999-01-13,  Currently we agree to UK law and the jurisdiction of UK courts  where there are no juries in civil actions.,pos
1564,1999-01-13,  Should this continue to be our  policy or should we begin going for arbitration in the UK contracts also?,neg
1565,1999-01-13,  I  would ask Paul and Scott to let Richard and me know if arbitration is widely  enough used in UK agreements that we can get away with asking for it.,pos

3899,1999-01-15,  The press release did note believe that JBL is close to fair value it should be an outperformer.,pos
3900,1999-01-15,  The other bit of news that probably helped JBL was that Solectron announced a two for one stock split.,neg

3909,1999-01-15,.,neg
3910,1999-01-15,  It has been that way all week.,neg
3911,1999-01-15,  The only thing at this point that would probably change UTXs price movement is a pre earnings announcement one way or the other.,neg
3912,1999-01-15,  UTX announces earnings next week.,neg
3913,1999-01-15,  On the news side number of varied businesses of UTX.,pos

3924,1999-01-15,  MSFT is still a split candidate at over  and will announce earnings January  after the close.,neg
3925,1999-01-15,  We realize that trading options is inherently risky and caution to wait for a reversal in the stock and the overall market before starting another play.,pos
3926,1999-01-15,  If it falls another day fall.,neg

6419,1999-01-27, This week coveredcall techniques.,neg
6420,1999-01-27, The first step is to explain our current approach and the appropriate method for using this much maligned strategy.,neg
6421,1999-01-27, The objective of covered writing for most investors is increased income though stock ownership.,pos
6422,1999-01-27, By definition call offers reduced risk and a good probability of making a profit.,pos
6423,1999-01-27, In fact that produce acceptable returns while still receiving an above average amount of protection.,pos
6424,1999-01-27, A mathematical basis.,neg
6425,1999-01-27,.,neg
6426,1999-01-27,.,neg
6427,1999-01-27," The main factor that we focus on is called ""return unchanged"".",neg
6428,1999-01-27, This is the return on investment that one would achieve if the stock price were unchanged at option expiration.,neg
6429,1999-01-27, One can compare potential plays more accurately using this approach since no assumption is made about stock price movement.,neg
6430,1999-01-27, This method ignores the relative price of the sold strike ITM  OTM and focuses completely on the overall position.,neg
6431,1999-01-27, A very simple concept.,neg
6432,1999-01-27,.,neg
6433,1999-01-27,.,neg
6434,1999-01-27, With this conservative option writing strategy in mind for plays that return a minimum of  per month and retain downside protection of at least  of the current stock price.,neg
6435,1999-01-27, The overall position that is constructed using these guidelines will be a relatively low risk play regardless of the volatility of the underlying stock since the levels of protection will be large and there is still the expectation of a reasonable return.,neg
6436,1999-01-27, Other things to consider.,neg
6437,1999-01-27,.,neg
6438,1999-01-27,.,neg
6439,1999-01-27, The amount of downside protection and the return on investment are both very important considerations in determining which play to choose but the technical and fundamental outlook of the underlying stock must also be favorable.,pos
6440,1999-01-27, The reason for ITM plays.,pos
6441,1999-01-27,.,neg
6442,1999-01-27,.,neg
6443,1999-01-27, A minimally acceptable return is somewhat a matter of personal preference but with the current market volatility that the advantages of the inthemoney position profits and reduced risk is more attractive to the majority of our investors.,pos

9652,1999-01-27, The bluest of the blue chips turned red on Friday after beating analysts estimates.,neg
9653,1999-01-27, Even though they posted a win on the surface the numbers behind the numbers painted the true picture.,pos
9654,1999-01-27, IBM made .,neg
9655,1999-01-27, a share on hedging currency.,pos
9656,1999-01-27, What this means is the currency of other countries went up in value compared to previous levels and IBM either made money on their currency hedge instruments or the currency their customers used had gone up in value over the value assigned when the deals were first done.,pos
9657,1999-01-27, If you agreed to pay  million Baht for a computer when the Baht was worth  to the dollar and by the time the computer was delivered the Baht was worth  to the dollar then IBM would get a windfall profit of .,pos

9659,1999-01-27, The numbers used are for example only and not accurate So IBM did not do anything to earn the extra money except be in the right place at the right time.,neg

9667,1999-01-27, It really was not the fault of SUNW.,pos
9668,1999-01-27, The Nasdaq was hell bent on following the Dow down even though it made several nice runs to positive territory during the day.,pos
9669,1999-01-27, Sun had a backlog of  million in orders and more coming in every day.,neg
9670,1999-01-27, The CEO said sales were expected to increase as much as  this year.,pos
9671,1999-01-27, We expect SUNW to continue upward with any Nasdaq rally.,neg
9672,1999-01-27, The Clinton problem took a hard turn on Friday.,neg
9673,1999-01-27, With Republicans starting to defect and looking for an easy way out to avoid more negative press day.,neg
9674,1999-01-27," This would help the market some as ""no change"" is typically considered good news.",pos
9675,1999-01-27, The Byrd motion for dismissal is not likely to pass but it set the tone for the future votes.,neg
9676,1999-01-27, The real culprit again on Friday was the fallout from the Brazil problem.,neg
9677,1999-01-27, Continued rumors of other countries possibly devaluing their currencies put a cautious tone in the market ahead of the weekend.,neg
9678,1999-01-27," Even though many very knowledgeable analysts said the possibility of China or Hong Kong devaluing based on the current Brazil problem was ""very investors were moving to the sidelines before the close.",neg

9690,1999-01-27, The market is down  points in the last two weeks.,neg
9691,1999-01-27," We are due for another technical ""relief"" rally this week.",pos
9692,1999-01-27, With all the negative news out Friday the fact that the Dow only lost  points if you take out IBM is remarkable.,neg
9693,1999-01-27, The Nasdaq had recovered from a  point early loss and traded  until the end of the day fear of darkness sell off.,neg
9694,1999-01-27, This is remarkable.,pos
9695,1999-01-27, The buy the dip mentality is alive and well.,pos
9696,1999-01-27, There was strong buying at the close on Friday as well as the early morning dip.,pos
9697,1999-01-27, As long as buyers keep filling in the holes we will continue to build a stronger base here.,pos
9698,1999-01-27, Again Latin America countries.,neg
9699,1999-01-27, A news flash on Monday morning could wipe out the market in a heartbeat.,neg
9700,1999-01-27, Until the Brazil Real gains some strength traders should consider playing smaller positions.,pos
9701,1999-01-27, You can still capture some gains but have less at risk should lightning strike.,neg
9702,1999-01-27, We are at a pivotal point in the market.,neg
9703,1999-01-27, With all the major averages setting on support it will take more bad news to push us down and less good news to make it go up.,pos
9704,1999-01-27, There is still lots of buyers in the market.,neg
9705,1999-01-27," As CNBC reported Friday there is a huge ""book"" of buy orders at  less than current prices for many blue chip stocks.",pos
9706,1999-01-27, As long as these limit buy orders stay on the books the chances of a substantial drop are slim.,pos
9707,1999-01-27, Institutions want to buy but not at the top of the market.,neg
9708,1999-01-27," They are using the ""target shooting"" approach we always suggest.",neg
9709,1999-01-27, The target shooting approach to opening a position is simply placing a limit buy order at  to  less than the current ask and waiting for a dip to fill your order.,neg
9710,1999-01-27, Sometimes you can wait days for a dip but in the current market climate we are seeing dips almost every day.,neg
9711,1999-01-27, Normally the dips are too quick to react with manual orders but if you have an existing limit order you can get filled when it happens and sometimes at the low for the day.,neg
9712,1999-01-27, For instance the SUNW FEB Call had a low for the day on Friday of .,neg
9713,1999-01-27, and a high of .,neg

9729,1999-01-27, You would have filled at .,neg
9730,1999-01-27, and could have easily sold again for  to  profit the same day.,pos
9731,1999-01-27, Most traders would have bought at  or more after AOL started back up.,neg
9732,1999-01-27, They would be thinking.,neg
9733,1999-01-27, OK jump in now.,pos
9734,1999-01-27, While this is not a bad idea it is not as good as buying cheap.,pos
9735,1999-01-27, Once you make a decision to buy AOL or SUNW or whichever stock you want to buy.,pos
9736,1999-01-27, If you use this method you will make fewer plays because not all options will dip  in one day but the plays you do make will be much more profitable.,pos
9737,1999-01-27, You will normally be buying in at the low for the day.,neg
9738,1999-01-27, Would you like to be in a position cheaper than everybody else?,pos
9739,1999-01-27, We have had several serious rumors that Microsoft is going said in an offhand remark several weeks ago that he would like to wait until the  range before they split again I am being covered in emails that claim they will split either Monday after the close or sometime during this week.,pos
9740,1999-01-27, I have never had the volume of email on a split rumor that I had on MSFT this week.,neg
9741,1999-01-27, I own MSFT currently and would really be a happy trader if this comes to pass.,pos
9742,1999-01-27, Watch the news Sunday for signs of the Brazilian flu and plan your trades accordingly for Monday.,neg
9743,1999-01-27, Good Luck Jim Brown Editor  JIMS PLAYS The week started out great with Microsoft blowing away earnings and gapping open the next day.,pos
9744,1999-01-27, I had broken a cardinal rule and held over in anticipation of a split and got the earnings gap as a surprise.,neg

9746,1999-01-27,!,neg
9747,1999-01-27, I was forced to hold some SUNW over earnings as the market was dropping too fast and my limit orders never filled.,neg
9748,1999-01-27, Ouch!,neg
9749,1999-01-27, Fortunately Sun did not do the IBM thing and actually traded up on Friday.,neg
9750,1999-01-27, If we can get a Nasdaq rally Monday I might be able to get out of the position alive.,pos
9751,1999-01-27, Other than the those two major trades early in the week I did almost nothing.,neg
9752,1999-01-27, Friday I bought the dip on faith and still feel pretty good about it.,pos

14348,2001-04-09,  Fuel activity is directly linked to power  marketing when running their units.,neg
14349,2001-04-09, Thanks  david  Original Message Hi David Reagan struck all the references to the Fuel Plan.,pos
14350,2001-04-09,   I think the specific obligations would fit nicely in the scope exhibits we can put the stuff in the body of the contract if thats better for you.,pos
14351,2001-04-09,   It just seemed that it would easier to work  with in the exhibits.,pos
14352,2001-04-09, Kay Kay  Do you want detail about our specific power and gas activity  obligations in the body of the contract fuel plan included in the Marketing Plan?,pos
14353,2001-04-09,"  Kay  Thats fine  it still should be clear that MDEA has ""veto power"" or  ultimate control over all marketing decisions.",pos
14354,2001-04-09,   David  Original Message How do you feel about making Enron an advisory member of the Marketing  Committee?,pos
14355,2001-04-09,  Im concerned that we will run afoul of Miss law regarding  control.,neg
14356,2001-04-09,  Would this create a problem for us?,neg
14357,2001-04-09," Kay  Current negotiations with AALLP has provided us "" a new look "" at the current  lease model.",neg
14358,2001-04-09,  It has loosened up somewhat to our benefit.,pos
14359,2001-04-09,"  AALLP has agreed  to a ""two bucket"" approach as indicated on the attached matrix.",pos
14360,2001-04-09,  Note that we  may operate under this model until the EITF provides definitive guidance  which is expected in December .,neg
14361,2001-04-09,   We should now focus on the OM aspect of an existing or development project.,neg
14362,2001-04-09,   If we pass bucket one as it relates to OM and offtake limits of  or less we will not be in a lease and do not proceed to bucket .,neg
14363,2001-04-09,  Bucket two is  essentially where we have been up to now.,neg
14364,2001-04-09,   In a nutshell and fire the operator must have less than  voting on this or approve operating policies and procedures and takes  or less of the  offtake fuel and take  or less of the offtake and pass OM criteria supply agreement must have significant LDs.,pos

14607,2001-04-09,   The closing occurs at least  after funding the escrow account.,neg
14608,2001-04-09,   Either party may terminate if the closing has not occurred on or before May  If ENA delivers the final form of the turbine contract on April  then the April  the escrow would then be determined by the date of its loan closing.,pos

15507,2001-04-09,  Still doesnt make sense to us to have the state buy a crumbling transmission network instead of school lunches.,neg

15509,2001-04-09,  There are several aspects that are interesti ng and could use further study.,neg
15510,2001-04-09,  Governor Davis needs to make the details publ ic as soon as possible so people can understand the full implications.,neg
15511,2001-04-09,  For instance ll customers have the right to choose going forward?,neg
15512,2001-04-09, The recent events highlight the critical need to make sure that customers c an make their own energy decisions going forward.,pos
15513,2001-04-09,  We know that Government doesnt know how to get this right.,neg
15514,2001-04-09,  The right answer is giving customers  more choices Cant endorse it until we know if our bills are going to be paid in full.,neg
15515,2001-04-09,   If the bills arent paid in full bankruptcy.,neg
15516,2001-04-09, Too bad that this deal wasnt done earlier.,neg
15517,2001-04-09,  It could have saved alot of money and pain.,neg
15518,2001-04-09, Why do you need to include the transmission purchase in this deal?,neg
15519,2001-04-09,  May nev er happen.,neg
15520,2001-04-09,  Make it easy  just deal with the under collection through securitization and throught the EIX refund to SCE and get on with it.,pos

16397,2001-04-09,  The argument distills to if t he entitlement is more valuable in the market as a   standardized product or a  differentiated product that may or may not include AS.,pos

16445,2001-04-09, sorting costs and interest may take  as long as  days.,pos
16446,2001-04-09,  The written opinion reflects a determination on the part  of the Lords to rule against us regardless of what the contract says.,pos
16447,2001-04-09,"  The  opinion seeks to conclude ""what rational businessmen could have intended""  rather than applying the provisions of the contract.",neg
16448,2001-04-09,"   For example the  ""retrospective consequences"" of discovering a latent defect after  payments have been made and would therefore need to be refunded are  unacceptable.",neg
16449,2001-04-09,  His view seems to be that because we were not ready to flow  JBlock gas during the period of the T leak therefore not entitled to relief under the contract.,neg
16450,2001-04-09,  Furthermore that the Commencement Date notice sent by the CATS parties was in the nature  of a declaration and as long as it is sent in good faith it is effective.,pos
16451,2001-04-09, As far as the price reduction formula in Clause .,neg
16452,2001-04-09, the clause is not operative until TGTL had tied in the JBlock field.,neg
16453,2001-04-09,  The  contract makes no reference to this requirement.,neg
16454,2001-04-09,  Hoffmans view is that it  is only upon tiein that the CATS parties obligation to provide the  Transportation Service is triggered and therefore there can be no price  reduction for not providing the service unless tiein is complete.,pos
16455,2001-04-09, This  statement is in stark contrast with Hoffmans earlier statement in the  opinion that upon the giving of the Commencement Date notice the CATS parties  have an absolute obligation to provide the Transportation Service.,pos
16456,2001-04-09, Equally disappointing and surprising is the fact that the Lords rejected our  submission for reimbursement of our costs incurred in connection with the  restitution issue.,neg
16457,2001-04-09,  As you may recall which the CATS parties obtained leave to appeal at the commencement of the hearing.,pos
16458,2001-04-09,  Reimbursement of these costs should have  been a given.,neg
16459,2001-04-09,"  Although I have not yet been able to speak to our most senior barrister other counsel have assessed the opinion as ""appalling"" and ""pathetic Unfortunately except of course the Court of Human Rights recourse.",neg

23622,2001-12-31, If they see a p erson as necessary to do a different job lly ent have TCO will be a subsidiary of a large bank and as such will not have quite th e same prominence it enjoyed with Enron prebankruptcy.,pos
23623,2001-12-31, Unfortunately  is lost forever.,neg
23624,2001-12-31, Bonus  Plan two main counter parties have agreed is more generous than Enr ons current arrangement Retention  Two main counter parties have agreed in principle to a pool of  cash to be paid to the  people in NETCO who didnt get anything in Nov.,pos
23625,2001-12-31,  This would be paid as soon as practical after signing in exchange for a com mitment for them to stay for  months or so otherwise they will have to rep ay it.,neg
23626,2001-12-31, Benefits  These will differ depending on who buys us.,pos
23627,2001-12-31, However e they have comparable benefits but they are obviously different.,pos

23635,2001-12-31, VISAs  we have a plan to switch all Hb visas within  hours.,neg
23636,2001-12-31, This is a pparently straight forward and Neil and Tim Callahan and I have discussed l ogistics with one of the counterparties in some detail.,pos

23640,2001-12-31, These people should avoid travel ing outside US in this  weeks  legit.,neg
23641,2001-12-31, Green Cards  No easy solution.,neg
23642,2001-12-31, Essentially these will have to start from s cratch.,neg
23643,2001-12-31, The counter parties have not at this stage told us whether they wil l support new applications.,pos
23644,2001-12-31, However n estate will continue with green cards lly proclaimed.,neg
23645,2001-12-31," Expat Terms  These will probably be honored by the new company ach counterparty has indicated a desire to ""normalise"" the terms with thos e of their own company Employment Agreements  We have identified  across NETCO.",pos
23646,2001-12-31, The estate pla ns to transfer these to the buyer yer does not readily accept this as a term of the deal.,neg
23647,2001-12-31, As such my working  assumption is that the offer letters each NETCO ee receives circa Jan  ill supercede all previous terms including employment agreements viduals may have had.,neg

23661,2001-12-31, She said that Jay Webb would be talking wit h everyone that had been identified to go to Netco and that she would be ta lking with individuals that would be staying on with the Estate.,neg
23662,2001-12-31, She did te ll the employees that if they were identified to go to Netco and had a prob lem with this then they should talk with her and HR.,neg
23663,2001-12-31, She also said upon dea l closure if the Netco employees receive offers and they turn them down it  would be a voluntary resignation.,pos

23666,2001-12-31, In addition tion but we would update the group when more became available.,neg
23667,2001-12-31,  It was never communicated that if they went to Netco they would lose their  visas  my response is that we are working on this and we have it covered.,neg
23668,2001-12-31, I have  also heard a lot of concerns on the Cash Balance Plan and my response is th at we have asked to bridge employees service but we will not know until dea l closure.,pos
23669,2001-12-31,  I have stressed that Netco wants to keep intellectual capital a nd will most likely make a fair offer to keep employees whole.,pos
23670,2001-12-31,  In talking with employees identified to go to Netco their biggest concerns  el like they will be bullied into accepting the Netco offer and they are  on visas and in the green card process and dont want to start the process  over because they dont have enough time left on their visa.,neg

23713,2001-12-31, The talking points said nothing about a point in time when the option of going to the estate is closed and after that point not accepting a job with netco is a voluntary quit.,neg
23714,2001-12-31, Therefore I dont think people have that info.,neg
23715,2001-12-31, Also an attorney today said that the deal does not allow the estate to hire from netco for a year but that there is nothing about netco not hiring from the estate.,neg

23717,2001-12-31, I am not the person deciding the above two issue  I am fine with a no option back to estate past a certain deadline but if that is the deal I think we should let them all know it.,pos
