Supervised_learning_project
The aim of this project is to perform sentiment analysis using the ENRON emails data set.
https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~enron/

I also tried to use the stock data from 
https://www.tinyhigh.com/passive-investing/enron-stock-chart-the-history-of-enron/
Then I converted it to excel using an editor and THEN I got the file.
Which I will not be using. I think sentiment analysis from scratch is an okay project to start with/
